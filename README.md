   - Passing and receiving parameters between screens using `params`.

2. **TypeScript**:
   - Enhancing code reliability and maintainability through proper typing.

3. **State Management**:
   - Using Context API and Redux Toolkit to manage favorite recipes.
   - Displaying the list of favorite recipes on a dedicated screen.

4. **Architecture**:
   - Following a modularized architecture for better code organization and scalability.
